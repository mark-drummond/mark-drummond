Welcome! I enjoy tokens, verifiable credentials, and pedantic adherence to technical specifications.

There‚Äôs really nothing here at the moment. Most of my work can be found in the IAM team Jira and Confluence pages. You can find me on LinkedIn, my blog that never gets regular attention, and over on Medium where I‚Äôve made some very meagre efforts at writing some identity related content.

My IT background is in Unix and Linux system operations, cloud operations, and digital identity. I am what I will call a ‚Äújunior‚Äù contributor to some of the technical committees at the CIO Strategy Council and I am also a part-time undergrad in Economics at Queen‚Äôs University.
