Welcome! I enjoy passkeys, verifiable credentials, and pedantic adherence to technical specifications. 🤓

There’s really nothing here at the moment. Most of my work can be found in the IAM team Jira and Confluence pages. You can find me on LinkedIn. I have a blog that never gets updated. I've written a few really bad articles on Medium. I'm also on the infosec.exchange Mastadon server, but I hardly ever visit there.

My IT background is in Unix and Linux system operations, cloud operations, and digital identity. I am what I will call a “junior” contributor to some of the technical committees at the Digital Governence Standards Institute, and I am a part-time undergrad in Economics at Queen’s University.

You can also find me over here: [@dmark](https://github.com/dmark/).
